## project-converter
This automation solves the problem where converting a task to a project puts it in the outermost level of the folder hierarchy. This causes all sorts of issues when focusing on specific folders/contexts.

## export-perspective
Choose a perspective to export out to a file that, when opened, can be added to another user's OmniFocus installation.

## export-taskpaper
Given a selected project, export a plain-text taskpaper export of the project. In an OmniFocus context, this taskpaper file can be copied, pasted to the inbox, then converted to a project.

## tag-stale-tasks (WIP)
Find tasks that seem stale, and should be on-hold, clarified, simplified, etc.
